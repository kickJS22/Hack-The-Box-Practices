commands:
	ftp + ipaddress -> To connect to a machine through ftp

Theory:
	FTP (File Transfer Protocol), to exchange files from a server to the client, using the ftp protocol we can see all the files on the FTP server because isn't encrypted, there is 
	another protocol called SFTP wich encrypts that exchange, or SSH that also encrypt the data.
